## My process

I started by building the frontend with hardcoded content to closely match the Figma design. Once the visual layout looked good, I set up the backend using Strapi, fetched the data, and replaced the hardcoded content with dynamic content from the backend. After that, I added animations to enhance the user experience.

One of the main challenges was hosting Strapi on a VPS, which proved to be tricky. Moving forward, Iâ€™d prefer using WordPress with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) for greater customization and easier management.

### Built with

- HTML
- SCSS
- TypeScript
- React
- Next.js
- Bulma
- Leaflet
- Strapi (backend)

### What I learned

- I learned how to use Strapi for the first time, which helped me understand backend content management.
- I also learned about hosting and managing domains, expanding my deployment skills.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus more on accessibility and SEO, as I did not consider these aspects in this project but recognize their importance.

### Useful resources

- Learned Strapi through various YouTube tutorials.
- For the frontend, I built upon knowledge from past projects to structure and style the application.
